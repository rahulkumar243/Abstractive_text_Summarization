# Abstractive_text_Summarization
My Machine Learning Intership Project with Suvidha Foundation.

This project focuses on generating abstractive summaries from news articles using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It was developed during my internship with Suvidha Foundation, as part of my exploration into deep learning and NLP models.

Project Description
Abstractive text summarization aims to generate a concise and coherent summary of a longer text by understanding its context and meaning, rather than simply extracting sentences. This project uses a sequence-to-sequence model architecture with an encoder-decoder structure, leveraging techniques such as attention mechanisms to improve the quality of the summaries.

The primary goal of this project is to build a model that can automatically generate human-like summaries from news articles. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles and their corresponding summaries, and it can be fine-tuned or extended for other domains as well.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The project includes data cleaning, tokenization, and other preprocessing steps essential for preparing the dataset.
Model Architecture: The project uses an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms to capture the context of the input text and generate coherent summaries.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using ROUGE scores, which are standard metrics for summarization tasks.
Training: Details on model training, including hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizer settings, are provided.
